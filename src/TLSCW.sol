*   Timelock Smart contract core implementation. 
*   Not upgradeable for the quicker prototyping purposes.
*   Instances are created using Clones library by OZ.
*   Ownership is allowed by simple Ownable pattern by OZ.
*   In production this approach can be shifted towards more flexibility via:
*       1) Introducing upgradeability via Beacon Proxies Pattern
*       2) Introducing ownership through Dharma's userSigningKey-like approach
